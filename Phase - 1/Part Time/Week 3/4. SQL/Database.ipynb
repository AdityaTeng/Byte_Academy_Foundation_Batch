    "## Types of DBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 major types of DBMS. Let's look into them in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hierarchical -\n",
    "    this type of DBMS employs the \"parent-child\" relationship of storing data. This type of DBMS is rarely used nowadays.\n",
    "    Its structure is like a tree with nodes representing records and branches representing fields. The windows registry used\n",
    "    in Windows XP is an example of a hierarchical database. Configuration settings are stored as tree structures with nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Network DBMS -\n",
    "    this type of DBMS supports many-to many relations. This usually results in complex database structures.\n",
    "    RDM Server is an example of a database management system that implements the network model.\n",
    "   Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDM_Server\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational DBMS -\n",
    "    this type of DBMS defines database relationships in form of tables, also known as relations. Unlike network DBMS,\n",
    "    RDBMS does not support many to many relationships. Relational DBMS usually have pre-defined data types that they\n",
    "    can support. This is the most popular DBMS type in the market. Examples of relational database management systems\n",
    "    include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object Oriented Relation DBMS - \n",
    "    this type supports storage of new data types. The data to be stored is in form of objects. The objects to be stored in\n",
    "    the database have attributes (i.e. gender, age) and methods that define what to do with the data. PostgreSQL is an \n",
    "    example of an object oriented relational DBMS.\n"
